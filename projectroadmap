https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCOkIMm2t70 was the video in which I based the majority of my project off of. The code that he explains here
is how I structured the majority of my project. I found that using this method was extremely simple and didnt require a lot of complex coding that would confuse me. I plan to add addtional metric of measurement in future updates once I grasp the fundamentals.

UPDATE 7/20/2022
