# UnitConversionProgram
This is my program for Application Development that I will be developing over the rest of the semester. 

This program is designed to convert units of measurement/temperature from standard to metric and from metric to standard.
Due to my limited coding capabilities, only a few units of measurement will be used for each category of measurement.

The units of measurement are as follows:
-Length
-Mass
-Capacity
-Temperature
