# UnitConversionProgram
This is my program for Application Development that I will be developing over the rest of the semester. 

This program is designed to convert units of measurement from standard to metric and from metric to standard.
Due to my limited coding capabilities, only a few units of measurement will be used for each category of measurement.

The units of measurement are as follows:
-Length
-Mass


  LENGTH:
Mile - Kilometer              (Multiply by 1.609347)
Inch - Millimeter             (Multiply by 25.4)
Inch - Centimeter             (Multiply by 2.54)
Foot - Meter                  (Multiply by 0.3048)
Yard - Meter                  (Multiply by 0.9144)

Kilometer - Mile              (Multiply by 0.6214)
Millimeter - Inch             (Multiply by 0.0394)
Centimeter - Inch             (Multiply by 0.3937)
Meter - Foot                  (Multiply by 3.281)
Meter - Yard                  (Multiply by 1.094)

  MASS:
Ounces - Grams                (Multiply by 28)      
Pounds - Kilograms            (Multiply by 0.45)
Short ton - metric ton        (Multiply by 0.9)

Grams - Ounces                (Multiply by 0.035)
Kilograms - Pounds            (Multiply by 2.2)
Metric tons - Short tons      (Multiply by 1.1)
