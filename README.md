# UnitConversionProgram
This is my program for Application Development that I will be developing over the rest of the semester. 

This program is designed to convert units of measurement from standard to metric and from metric to standard.
Due to my limited coding capabilities, only a few units of measurement will be used for each category of measurement.

The units of measurement are as follows:
-Length
-Mass


  LENGTH:
Mile - Kilometer              (Multiply by 1.609347)
Inch - Millimeter             (Multiply by 25.4)
Inch - Centimeter             (Multiply by 2.54)
Foot - Meter                  (Multiply by 0.3048)
Yard - Meter                  (Multiply by 0.9144)

Kilometer - Mile              (Multiply by 0.6214)
Millimeter - Inch             (Multiply by 0.0394)
Centimeter - Inch             (Multiply by 0.3937)
Meter - Foot                  (Multiply by 3.281)
Meter - Yard                  (Multiply by 1.094)

  MASS:
Ounces - Grams                (Multiply by 28)      
Pounds - Kilograms            (Multiply by 0.45)
Short ton - metric ton        (Multiply by 0.9)

Grams - Ounces                (Multiply by 0.035)
Kilograms - Pounds            (Multiply by 2.2)
Metric tons - Short tons      (Multiply by 1.1)


I will be putting each conversion portion into a seperate function, as shown in the example video that I have linked in my ProjectRoadMap file. At the end, I will ask for an input on what conversion they would like to do, then I will use a series of if statements to bring the user to the correct function. Once all there calculations are done, the user will be able to see the history of all conversion completed.

UPDATE 7/20/2022
- All main functions have been complete for calculations. Spending the rest of my time finishing up main (WHILE TRUE) loop in order to have a unlimited conversion caluclator at the users discretion. Final code was added to final code page. 

2nd UPDATE 7/20/2022
- Added the MASS measurments in print_menu
